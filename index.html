                    <p class="about-me-1">
                        I am a basketball player and a gamer at heart.<br>
                        I'm from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina I love<br> to meet new people, am very social and <br>
                        always up for learning something new.<br>
                        
                        I've had an interest in computers ever since I<br>
                        was a kid but I never really went in depth with<br>
                        how they work or how to program until I was<br>
                        17-18 years old.<br>
                        

                        I Started with a course in C++(Wouldn't<br>
                        recommend that for any beginner) and then<br>
                        Python and C# because I wanted to make<br>
                        some video games.

                    <p class="about-me-2">
                        I signed up for Multimedia design last year<br>
                        in the hopes that I could further my skills in<br>
                        coding and programming while also getting<br>
                        a diploma.<br>
                        
                        To meet people along the way that share<br>
                        my interests and aspirations.<br>
                        
                        I aspire to be a full-stack developer.<br>
                        Programming has been a passion for me<br>
                        ever since and Multimedia design is a way<br>
                        for me to put that passion to use.

                    <p class="skill-par">
                        My skillset currently includes the use of HTML5<br>
                        for Mark-up and SEO optimization, CSS3 and<br>
                        SASS for styling the website and making it<br>
                        responsive on mobile devices and tablets, and <br>
                        JavaScript for making dynamic frontend websites.<br>
                        
                        I use Adobe XD for prototyping and designing<br>
                        the website after I sketch it in low-fidelity. For<br>
                        editing and resizing the pictures I use <br>
                        Photoshop and Lightroom. And finally for<br>
                        making icons and illustrations I use Adobe
                        Illustrator.<br>
                        
                        Along with that I am also experienced with video<br>
                        editing, specifically in Premiere Pro. One of my<br>
                        course projects was actually to make an <br>
                        interactive video using JavaScript.

                        My design process so far has always<br>
                        started by conducting research on<br>

                        focus groups, analyzing the<br>
                        gathered data, making affinity<br>
                        diagrams.

                        Then I move on to prototyping.<br>
                        With all of the gathered data, I sketch<br>
                        out low-fidelity prototypes on paper to<br>
                        narrow down how the basis of the<br>

                        Once that is narrowed down I make a<br>
                        high-fidelity prototype in Adobe XD

                        Finally, once the high-fidelity prototype<br>
                        is finished, I move on to coding the<br>
                        product, making it into an actual<br>

                        Starting off by writing in the text and<br>
                        SEO optimization with HTML5, then<br>
                        styling it with CSS3, and finally<br>
                        adding dynamic components with JavaScript.
